# RxJava2 Reactive Audio Recorder


A reactive (RxJava 2) implementation of the AudioRecord API for recording raw (pcm) audio-data

## Download 
Repository available on https://jitpack.io/#hannesa2/RxAudioRecorder

```Gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
```Gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "com.github.hannesa2:RxAudioRecorder:$latestVersion"
}

```

### Usage

```kotlin
ObservableAudioRecorder recorder = ObservableAudioRecorder.Builder(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.CAMCORDER)
                                      .sampleRate(22050)
                                      .stereo()
                                      .file(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().absolutePath + "/sample.wav")
                                      .build()
```


##### Use the recorder OnSubscribe to create an observable

```kotlin
Observable.create(observableAudioRecorder)
        .subscribe({ shorts ->
            ...
            observableAudioRecorder!!.writeDataToFile(shorts)
        }) { throwable -> errorhandling(throwable) }
```

#### After setting up the Observer, manipulate the recording-process by using these methods

| Name | Description |
|:----:|:-----------:|
| start() | Starts the recorder and moves it to *Recording* state |
| stop() | Stops the recorder and moves it to *Stopped* state |
| pause() | Pauses the recorder and moves it to *Paused* state |
| resume() | Resumes the recorder if it's in *Paused* state |
| isRecording() | Returns true if the recorder is in *Recording* state |
| isRecordingStopped() | Checks whether the recorder is in *Stopped* state or not |

#### Helper methods for wave file write operations

| Name | Description |
|:----:|:-----------:|
| writeDataToFile(shorts) | Writes the short buffers to wave file |
| completeRecording() | Writes the Wave header info to the file (Call it after *stop()* method) |
